# Rust-http-server

# Motivation
I self-studied Rust and was unsure about what side project to undertake during my freshman year.
Therefore, I decided to write an HTTP Server with Rust, allowing others to call the server and obtain the resources they need.

# Dependencies
* [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
* [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored)

(you can see more in `Cargo.toml`)

# Usage
1. Enter this command in this directory
```shell
$ cargo run
```
2. Open the browser and you can see `Hello, World!` on the page
3. Also, some HTTP message appeared in the console
